# QikServe's Front End Challenge | QikOrder

The main goal of this challenge consists to propose a solution to improve the codebase of two products that has different purposes but some of the elements in UI are the same (e.g. menu items).

## Products

QikOrder (this repository) is a product designed to place orders for open check (you are a in the restaurant, choose a table, order for this table and then pay when finish).  
This project is recent and was built in ReactJS.

[Web Orders](https://github.com/qsengineers/web-orders) is a product designed to place orders for take away and delivery.  
This project is old and was built in AngularJS.

## Expectations

Basically I expect to see a solution that will reuse components/elements in both products.  
Let’s take the menu item as example:

* It has the same styles in both products
* It's an AngularJS component on [Web Orders](https://github.com/qsengineers/web-orders) product
* It's a React component on QikOrder product

So how to create this component in way that’s possible to reuse in both products?
